				<h2>Jupiter</h2>
				<span>Planet</span>
				<p>
					Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.

				<h2>Earth</h2>
				<span>Planet</span>
				<p>
					Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.

				<h2>Mercury</h2>
				<span>Planet</span>
				<p>
					Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28Â° away from the Sun as viewed from Earth.

				<h2>Mars</h2>
				<span>Planet</span>
				<p>
					Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

				<h2>Venus</h2>
				<span>Planet</span>
				<p>
					Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn.
